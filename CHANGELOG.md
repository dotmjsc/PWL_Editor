## 1.4 - 2025-09-22

Enhancements
- Plot selection box (Table-only): added robust event lifecycle and border clamping
- Repeated box selection: fixed stale rectangle cleanup; rectangle can be drawn multiple times

Fixes
- Undo safety: replaced unintended update_plot() calls in selection/table handlers with _update_plot_internal()
- Border interactions: clamped pixel coords to axes for drag/move/release, enabling selection when releasing outside plot
- Undo edge case: guarded max() logging in parser to avoid errors on empty datasets

Internal
- Connected/disconnected matplotlib events on tab changes; initial connect when starting in Table mode
- Added GPT-5 (OpenAI) to AI Tools attribution
